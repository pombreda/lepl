# Welcome to the Lepl Wiki #

It seems like this might be a good way to collect examples.

To avoid spam, people need to be registered before they can post.  To register, send an email to andrew@acooke.org along with your Google username (whatever you use to login to GMail, for example).

**Important** - don't forget to set the "page name" when you create a new page (probably using a WikiWord that describes the example) as I can't see how to change the page names once they have been added.

Have fun + thanks,

Andrew
